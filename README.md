# Streamline Utilites for Unity3D

## Purpose
This is a collection of scripts I am putting together through my journey as a game dev to streamline remedial tasks such as setting up player controllers.

## Player Controller ToolKit

### Philosophy
As the Gaming Industry develops, player movement is becoming an integral part of the gaming experience. Player movement is also becoming a game mechanic which heavily determines a player's success or failure. Whether you are a professional or hobbiest, you may feel inclined to tweak your movement until it is perfect. This toolkit is intended to provide a sound basis so you can get your player moving, and then return whenever you feel player movement needs to be improved or taken in a different direction.

### Description
A framework which provides basic, physics-based player movement, and a camera controller. This toolkit is intended as a simple way for lone-developers or small developer teams to implement physics-based player movement, and a camera controller, with very little effort. For some, this toolkit may be enough, but others are free to add and change functionality as needed to create the best player movement experience possible.

### Components
1. m_CharacterController - Provides a basis for physcis-based movement, and automatically limits the player to never travel faster than the define maximum speed
2. m_CameraController - Provides a basis for a camera controller
